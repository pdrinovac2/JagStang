# JagStang in Java 3D

Model of a Fender JagStang made entirely in Java 3D. 

To run, create a Java project and add all files and directories. The default package is safe to be used. Additionally, Java 3D may need to be install in your machine. Here is a link to the download files: https://java3d.java.net/binary-builds.html

The j3dcore.jar, j3dutils.jar, and vecmath.jar from Java 3D should be added to the libraries folder in the project to be properly run.

Information on the project itself can be found in the Report.txt file.
